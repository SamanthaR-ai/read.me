- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Sam. 
- I'm currently working through FreeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design Certificate. My goal is over the next 6 months I want to build a portfolio that will land me a roll as a Front End/Full Stack Engineer. 
- A huge marvel/horror movie fan. 
- I will be posting my certification projects here.
